    <center>The page should redirect soon. If this is taking a while, refresh the page, or contact @WatchAndGame Or @AIGamesDeveloper.</center>

    Fun fact, This used to be the landing page, but it was moved due to issues with folders (I'm assuming).
      Also, there is no way your able to read this unless you got stuck. So.... if you did, maybe reload, or contact the above, preferably @WatchAndGame.
